# PWA(Progressive Web APP) Docs

## What is PWA ?

- PWA stands for Progressive Web App. It is a type of web application that is designed to provide an experience that is similar to that of a native mobile app. PWAs use modern web technologies such as service workers, web app manifests, and push notifications to create an app-like experience in the browser.
- One of the key features of a PWA is its ability to work offline or on poor network connections. This is achieved through the use of service workers, which can cache content and resources, allowing the app to continue functioning even if the network connection is lost.
- PWAs are also installable, meaning that they can be added to a user's home screen and launched like a native app. This improves the user experience by providing quick and easy access to the app without the need to navigate to it through a web browser.
- Overall, PWAs offer many advantages over traditional web apps, including improved performance, offline functionality, and an app-like experience.

## What is the difference between PWA and SPA ?

PWA and SPA are both web application technologies, but they have different focuses and purposes.

PWA stands for Progressive Web App, which is a web application that is designed to provide an experience that is similar to that of a native mobile app. PWAs use modern web technologies such as service workers, web app manifests, and push notifications to create an app-like experience in the browser. The key features of a PWA include offline functionality, installability, and push notifications.

SPA stands for Single Page Application, which is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app. SPAs typically use JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue to manage the app's state and handle user interactions. The key features of an SPA include fast load times, seamless navigation, and smooth user interactions.

The main difference between PWA and SPA is their focus. PWAs are focused on providing an app-like experience in the browser, with features such as offline functionality and installability. SPAs are focused on providing a smooth and responsive user experience, with fast load times and seamless navigation.

That being said, it is worth noting that PWAs can also be SPAs. In fact, many PWAs are built using JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular to manage the app's state and handle user interactions. However, not all SPAs are PWAs, as PWAs require additional features such as service workers and web app manifests to provide offline functionality and installability.
